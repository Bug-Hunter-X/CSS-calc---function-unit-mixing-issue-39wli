The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and `vh` units:

```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% - 10vh);
}
```

This code intends to make the container's width 50% of its parent's width, minus 10vh (viewport height). However, the `calc()` function might not behave as expected due to unit mixing.  Some browsers might not correctly interpret the subtraction of a `vh` unit from a percentage unit.
