This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the `calc()` function and unit mixing. The bug occurs when subtracting viewport height units (`vh`) from percentage units within the `calc()` function. Some browsers may not handle this correctly, leading to unexpected results. The `bug.css` file shows the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.css` file shows a solution that provides better cross-browser compatibility.
